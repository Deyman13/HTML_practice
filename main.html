        March 1701, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society published an anonymous note in 
        <br>
        Latin titled “A Scale of the Degrees of Heat” [1]. Though no name was indicated, it was no secret
        <br> 
        that Isaac Newton was the author (he would become “Sir Isaac” four years later). In a series of
        <br> 
        experiments, Newton observed that

    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: darkslategray; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
        - a modern statement of a law that today bears his name [2]. Expressed mathematically, Newton's law
        <br>
        of cooling gives rise to the heat diffusion equation, a partial differential equation (PDE) which 
        <br>
        in the simplest form reads

        Here, x(u,t) denotes the temperature at time t and point u on some domain, the lhs (temporal derivative ẋ)
        <br> 
        is the “rate of change of temperature” and the rhs (spatial second-order derivative or the Laplacian Δx) 
        <br>
        expresses the local difference between the temperature of a point and its surrounding, and a is the proportion 
        <br>
        coefficient known as the thermal diffusivity. This PDE is linear and its solution can be given in closed form 
        <br>
        as the convolution of the initial temperature distribution with a time-dependent Gaussian kernel [3],

        iffusion PDEs arise in many physical processes involving the transfer of “stuff” (whether energy or matter),
        <br> 
        or more abstractly, information. In image processing, one can exploit the aforementioned interpretation 
        <br>
        of diffusion as linear low-pass filtering for image denoising. However, while removing noise such a filter
        <br> 
        also undesirably blurs transitions between regions of different colour or brightness (“edges”). 
        <br>
        An influential insight of Pietro Perona and Jitendra Malik [5] was to consider an adaptive diffusivity 
        <br>
        coefficient inversely dependent on the norm of the image gradient |∇x|: this way, diffusion is strong in 
        <br>
        “flat” regions (where |∇x|≈0) and weak in the presence of brightness discontinuities (where |∇x| is large).
        <br> 
        The result was a nonlinear filter capable of removing noise from the image while preserving edges.

        Perona-Malik diffusion and similar schemes created an entire field of PDE-based techniques that 
        <br>
        also drew inspiration and methods from geometry, calculus of variations, and numerical analysis [6]. 
        <br>
        For me personally, the works of Ron Kimmel on the numerical geometry of images [7] were the reason to 
        <br>
        fall in love with differential geometry and do a PhD on this topic. Variational and PDE-based methods 
        <br>
        dominated the stage of image processing and computer vision for nearly twenty years, ceding to deep 
        <br>
        learning in the second decade of the 2000s [8].

        our recent work at Twitter [9], we relied on the same philosophy to take a fresh look at graph neural networks.
        <br> 
        GNNs operate by exchanging information between adjacent nodes in the form of message passing, a process 
        <br>
        that is conceptually equivalent to diffusion. In this case, the base space is the graph and the diffusion 
        <br>
        happens along edges, where the analogy of the spatial derivatives is the differences between adjacent node 
        <br>
        features.
        <br>
        <br>
        Formally, the generalisation of diffusion processes to graphs is almost straightforward: 
        the equation looks identical,
        <br>
    </p>

    <div style="padding-inline-start:100px; color: darkcyan; font-size: 30px; font-family: monospace;">

    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: darkslategray; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
        where X(t) is now an n*d matrix of node features at time t, the gradient is an operator assigning 
        <br>
        to each edge u~v the difference of the respective node feature vectors, (∇X)ᵤᵥ=xᵥ-xᵤ wheres the 
        <br>
        divergence at node u sums the features of edges emanating from it, (div(X))ᵤ= ∑ᵥ wᵤᵥ xᵤᵥ [10]. 
        <br>
        The diffusivity is represented by a matrix-valued function of the form A(X)=diag(a(xᵤ, xᵥ)), 
        <br>
        where, as before, a is a function determining the strength of diffusion along edge u~v based on 
        <br>
        the similarity of the respective features xᵤ and xᵥ [11].

            Node and edge features are analogous to scalar and vector fields on graphs, respectively. 
            <br>
            The gradient produces edge features of the form (∇X)ᵤᵥ=xᵥ-xᵤ. The divergence produces node 
            <br>
            features of the form (div(X))ᵤ= ∑ᵥ wᵤᵥ xᵤᵥ.

        In most cases [12], this differential equation has no closed-form solution and has to be solved numerically. 
        <br>
        There are a plethora of numerical techniques for solving nonlinear diffusion equations differing primarily 
        <br>
        in the choice of spatial and temporal discretisation.

    <div style="padding-inline-start:100px; color: darkcyan; font-size: 30px; font-family: monospace;">
        X(k+1)=[(1-𝜏)I+𝜏A(X(k))]X(k)=Q(k)X(k)
    </div>

    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: darkslategray; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
        we get the formula of an explicit or forward Euler scheme, where the next iteration X(k+1) is 
        <br>
        computed from the previous one X(k) by applying a linear operator Q(k) [13], starting from some X(0). 
        <br>
        This scheme is numerically stable (in the sense that a small perturbation in the input X(0) results in 
        <br>
        a small perturbation to the output X(k)) only when the time step is sufficiently small. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Using backward time difference to discretise the temporal derivative leads to the (semi-)implicit scheme,
    </p>

    <div style="padding-inline-start:100px; color: darkcyan; font-size: 30px; font-family: monospace;">
        [(1+𝜏)I-𝜏A(X (k))]X(k + 1) = B (k) X (k + 1) = X (k)
    </div>

    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: darkslategray; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
        named thus because deducing the next iterate from the previous one requires solving a linear system 
        <br>
        amounting to the inversion of B (in most cases carried out approximately, by a few iterations of a linear solver).
        <br> 
        This scheme is unconditionally stable, meaning that we can use any 𝜏>0 without worrying that the iterations 
        will blow up.
        <br>
        <br>
        These are the conceptually simplest discretisation techniques that do not necessarily work the best in practice. 
        <br>
        In the PDE literature, it is common to use multi-step schemes such as Runge-Kutta [14] where the subsequent 
        <br>
        iterate is computed as a linear combination of a few previous ones. Both the explicit and implicit cases can 
        <br>
        be made multi-step. Furthermore, the step size can be made adaptive, depending on the approximation error [15].

        family of graph neural network-like architectures we call Graph Neural Diffusion (or, somewhat immodestly,

        GRAND for short). The output is the solution X(T) of the diffusion equation at some end time T. 
        <br>
        Many popular GNN architectures can be formalised as instances of GRAND — parametric discretised graph 
        <br>
        diffusion equations. Specifically, the explicit scheme mentioned above has the form of a Graph Attention 
        <br>
        Network [16], where our diffusivity plays the role of attention.

            In Graph Neural Diffusion, explicit GNN layers are replaced with the continuous analog of diffusion time.
            <br>
            This scheme allows training deep networks (running the diffusion for a long time) without experiencing

        mplicit schemes allow using larger time steps and thus fewer iterations (“layers”) at the expense of 
        <br>
        the computational complexity of the iteration, which requires inversion of the diffusion operator. 
        <br>
        The diffusion operator (the matrix A in our equation) has the same structure of the adjacency matrix of 
        <br>
        the graph (1-hop filter), while its inverse is usually a dense matrix that can be interpreted as a 
        <br>
        multi-hop filter.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since the efficiency of matrix inversion crucially depends on the structure of the matrix, in some 
        <br>
        situations it might be advantageous to decouple the graph used for diffusion from the input graph. 
        <br>
        Such techniques, collectively known as graph rewiring, have become a popular approach to deal with 
        <br>
        scalability or information bottlenecks in GNNs. The diffusion framework offers a principled view on 
        <br>
        graph rewiring by considering the graph as a spatial discretisation of some continuous object 
        <br>
        (e.g. a manifold) [18], and some discretisations are more advantageous numerically.

        <br>
        It was created by scientist David Holtz, who worked at the NASA Research Center and the Max Planck Institute. 
        <br>
        Midjourney can be considered a technological breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. 
        <br>
        Its closest competitors are Dall—E 2 (closed neural network) and Dall-E Mini (rather, entertainment). 
        <br>
        Unlike them, Midjourney is open and has an applied value — it quickly and efficiently converts text into images. 
        <br>
        Midjourney is currently in beta testing and is available to users worldwide. 
        <br>
        This means that anyone can create images based on text queries.
        <br>
        <br>
        The beta version of Midjourney is only available in Discord.

        table Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic 
        <br>
        images given any text input, cultivates autonomous freedom to produce incredible imagery, empowers 
        <br>
        billions of people to create stunning art within seconds.
        <br>
        The program from the Stability AI group went public in August 2022. The neural network can qualitatively 
        <br>
        generate images based on a text query, finish sketches and alter reference images in its own way. 
        <br>
        All this is free, and the open source code allows you to install Stable Diffusion on your computer and 
        <br>
        use your own computing power.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is also a downside to this: not all devices fit the system requirements, and programming skills 
        <br>
        are needed to use the full version of Stable Diffusion. But enthusiasts have already developed websites,
        <br> 
        applications, bots and programs based on the network. We figured out what is interesting about Stable Diffusion 
        <br>
        and how to try a neural network, even if you don't know how to program.

    </p>

    <ul class="readme" style="font-size: 30px; color: rgb(155, 5, 5);">
        <li>In order for the program to work, you will need a Windows or Linux computer with a video card 
            <br>
            with a memory capacity of 4 or 8 GB. These are the minimum requirements — the more powerful 
            <br>
            the resources, the faster the images will be generated. If you have a Mac OS, you will need a 
            <br>
            system version no older than 12.3, and the device must have an M1 or M2 processor.</li>
        <li>A full version of Stable Diffusion requires programming skills. But there are already neural
            <br> 
            network-based services: they are much easier to learn, but also not as powerful.</li>
